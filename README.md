Get your Butt in the Gym

Spring 2019, BIT 286 Students, this is our story. Our MVP for the quarter was to allow coaches to quickly view, search and follow athletes.

This meant we needed to get a registration working for coaches and athletes. The mentioned users can also enter and save personal information and this all gets correctly stored in the database. Coaches can search for ahtletes using a basic search or a more advanced search. The program uses the identity framework. The position data for the users is seperate from the roles. Views were updated to be able to handle and show all this information. Also being worked on by another intern was an Athlete page that coaches could view. This had not been merged at this time. What we thought the next steps could: Add a button and functionality for a coach to be able to follow an athlete. Coach view with a list of their followed athletes. Coach needs verification that they are actually a coach.
