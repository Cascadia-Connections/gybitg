Get your Butt in the Gym

Our MVP for the quarter was to allow coaches to quickly view, search and follow athletes.

This meant we needed to get a registration working for coaches and athletes. The mentioned users can also enter and save personal information and this all gets correctly stored in the database. Coaches can search for ahtletes using a basic search or a more advanced search. The program uses the identity framework. The position data for the users is seperate from the roles. Views were updated to be able to handle and show all this information. Also being worked on by another intern was an Athlete page that coaches could view. This had not been merged at this time. What we thought the next steps could: Add a button and functionality for a coach to be able to follow an athlete. Coach view with a list of their followed athletes. Coach needs verification that they are actually a coach.  Need more data validation on advanced search.

Client thought that maybe coach verification could come from .edu emails or another sort of educational email address.  There will also need to be age verification to the site during registration.

There have been multiple people working on this code.  There are parts that are not currently being used and things that are still a work in progress.
